# JavaScript JIRA API for node.js #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/steves/node-jira.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/steves/node-jira)

A node.js module, which provides an object oriented wrapper for the JIRA REST API.

This library is built to support version `2.0.alpha1` of the JIRA REST API.
This library is also tested with version `2` of the JIRA REST API
  It has been noted that with Jira OnDemand, `2.0.alpha1` does not work, devs
  should revert to `2`. If this changes, please notify us.

JIRA REST API documentation can be found [here](http://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/)

## Installation ##

  Install with the node package manager [npm](http://npmjs.org):

    $ npm install jira

or

  Install via git clone:

    $ git clone git://git://github.com/steves/node-jira.git
    $ cd node-jira
    $ npm install

## Example ##

Find the status of an issue.

    JiraApi = require('jira').JiraApi;

    var jira = new JiraApi('https', config.host, config.port, config.user, config.password, '2.0.alpha1');
    jira.findIssue(issueNumber, function(error, issue) {
        console.log('Status: ' + issue.fields.status.name);
    });

Currently there is no explicit login call necessary as each API call uses Basic Authentication to authenticate. 

## Options ##

JiraApi options:
*  `protocol<string>`: Typically 'http:' or 'https:'
*  `host<string>`: The hostname for your jira server
*  `port<int>`: The port your jira server is listening on (probably `80` or `443`)
*  `user<string>`: The username to log in with
*  `password<string>`: Keep it secret, keep it safe
*  `Jira API Version<string>`: Known to work with `2` and `2.0.alpha1`
*  `verbose<bool>`: Log some info to the console, usually for debugging
*  `strictSSL<bool>`: Set to false if you have self-signed certs or something non-trustworthy
*  `context<string>`: Context path used when constructing JIRA URL, leave as empty if JIRA is the default context
